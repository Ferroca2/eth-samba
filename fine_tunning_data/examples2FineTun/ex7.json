        "description": "OpenArt secures revenues by charging a flat 2.5% commission on all sales. This proposal advocates changing to a variable commission system based on the listing price of the NFT. Artwork listed at a higher price would incur a smaller percentage commission, while those at lower prices would face a higher rate. This could optimize platform revenues and balance the scale of fees for sellers. A thoughtful discussion and feedback is required from our community and token holders."

        "title": "Implement Tiered Commission Cap for Inclusive Profit Optimization",
        "description": "Based on community feedback, the revised proposal maintains a flat 2.5% commission, introducing a tier-based cap on total commission. Lower-priced artworks will have a lower cap, reducing the burden on smaller artists, while higher-priced pieces will have a higher cap, still taking a smaller percentage of the sale but ensuring meaningful revenue for the platform. This approach tries to incentivize premium listings without compromising on inclusivity. It balances the progressive ethos of NFTs with operational sustainability. Token holders are urged to thoughtfully consider this revised proposal."
