        "description": "Currently, DataChain charges users a nominal fee for data storage. To improve the network infrastructure and provide better service quality, both in speed and reliability, this proposal suggests an increase in storage fees. It would allow for future enhancements and maintenance of the platform. As this could directly impact user costs, open discussion and feedback from the community and token holders are needed."

        "title": "Introducing Data Usage Tiers for Efficiency and Infrastructure Improvement",
        "description": "After thorough consideration of community opinions, this counter-proposal recommends implementing a tier-based pricing strategy. Users would be categorized based on their data usage, with fees structured accordingly. Low-volume users would face minimal costs, while higher volume users, benefiting more from infrastructure upgrades, would contribute more. This ensures improvements do not disproportionately impact less frequent users. Furthermore, the implementation of a loyalty program will offer bonuses to long-term users, making the transition smoother. Community members and token holders are urged to evaluate this balanced proposal."
