        "description": "VerifyDAO currently charges a blanket fee for all verification requests. This proposal suggests implementing a tiered charging system based on the urgency of verification. A premium fee will be charged for rapid verification requests, with normal requests retaining current fees. Income generated could be used to improve service delivery and scale the platform. Careful assessment and inputs are, however, needed from token holders and the community."

        "title": "Integration of Value-Based Service Charges for Verification Requests",
        "description": "In response to the diverse views from the community, a revised proposal is made â€“ a value-based system that links fees to the complexity and speed of verification. This addresses the concern about unfairly prioritizing rapid verifications and potentially slowing normal requests. Instead of only time-based, the complexity level of verification tasks will play a part in fee determination. Such a system, while maintaining profits, aptly aligns users' costs with the value derived. Before its full integration, a pilot phase will be run to assess its impact. In this phase, feedback will be collected and necessary adjustments made. We encourage the platform's community and token holders to deliberate on this improved proposal."
