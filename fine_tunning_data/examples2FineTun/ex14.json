        "description": "Presently, ArtDigi allows any and all artists to mint and list their NFTs without oversight. This proposal suggests the establishment of an Art Curation Panel that will assess and approve artworks before they are minted as NFTs. This panel aims to maintain a high level of artwork quality and preserve the platform's reputation for quality NFTs. As this change will impact creators' power to mint freely and potentially the variety of artworks on our platform, it urges discussion and feedback from the community and token holders."

        "description": "Taking into account the community's concern over the inclusivity and openness of our platform, the counter-proposal recommends for a voluntary curation. Artists who want their NFTs listed with an accredited tag can submit their work for curation. It ensures quality control without hampering the democratization of art. Importantly, part of the curation panel will be elected by the community, ensuring a fair representation. We believe this change will strengthen the value of the accredited NFTs and empower artists. Token holders and community members are encouraged to discuss this revised proposal."
