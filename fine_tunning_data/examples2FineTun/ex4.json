To ensure sustainability and profitability, this proposal suggests increasing the underwriting fee to 2.5%. The adjustment might generate more revenue and ensure the platform's service quality. However, it requires thoughtful consideration from our community and token holders."

        "description": "Reflecting community's feedback, this counter-proposal suggests a gradual rather than an immediate increase in the underwriting fee, shifting from 2% to 2.5% over a defined period. This more conservative approach acknowledges the impacts on the user experience and market competitiveness. Fees will only rise for high-risk policies, while long-term users will be offered a discount. All measures aim to balance profitability with user satisfaction and market competitiveness. All revenue from this restructuring will be channeled towards improving InsureDAO's services and claim processing speed, ensuring both enhanced user experience and sustainability of the platform. We urge the platform's community and token holders to deliberate on this careful balance of considerations."
