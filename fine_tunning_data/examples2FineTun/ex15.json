This proposal suggests the formation of a Property Verification Team. The team's role would be to verify the property documents and the rights of the lister to sell or lease the property. Implementation of this plan will help reduce fraud and increase the reliability of property listings on PropBlock. Considering the possible impact on the time-to-list and user experience, this proposal invites the community and token holders to give their feedback."

To assure fairness, the community will have input on the selection of the Property Verification Team. This ensures efficient functionality without compromising the platform's decentralized ethos. As always, the community and token holders are encouraged to share their perspectives."
