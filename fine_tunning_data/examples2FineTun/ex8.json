        "title": "Introduction of Entry Fee for Predictors to Minimize Market Noise",
        "description": "At present, anyone can participate in predictions on PolyPredict without any entry fee. However, this has led to a lot of noise with numerous non-serious predictions. This proposal suggests an introduction of a minimal entry fee for predictors. This can potentially help improve the quality of predictions and also generate some revenue for the platform. Feedback is needed from token holders and the community."

        "title": "Establishing a Refundable Entry Fee coupled with a Predictor Scoring System",
        "description": "Taking into consideration community views, instead of a direct entry fee, this revised proposal suggests a refundable entry fee model. Predictors paying a minimal fee can participate, with refunds given for accurate predictions within a certain range. This maintains platform accessibility and encourages careful prediction. Moreover, a scoring system will be established to track predictor performance. Those consistently underperforming may face restrictions, promoting serious, quality predictions. The proposal aims for a credible and reliable platform without limiting participation. Community members and token holders are encouraged to evaluate this proposal."
