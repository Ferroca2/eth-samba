        "description": "Currently, PredictChain has no formalized system for handling disputes in prediction markets. This proposal recommends the introduction of an arbitration system, where selected community members (arbitrators) resolve market disputes. The goal is to improve fairness in the system and to tackle misinterpretations, ambiguous market wordings, or other inconsistencies. This proposal being a major change, careful discussion and feedback from the community and token holders are required."

        "description": "Revising the initially proposed arbitration system based on the community's concerns about centralization, bias and transparency, this proposal puts forth a community-governed arbitration system. Arbitrators are elected from the community via voting, expected to uphold fair and transparent dispute resolution. Specific criteria for eligibility, detailed guidelines for dispute identification, and provisions for an appeal mechanism will be included. This aims to resolve market disputes while respecting the key principle of decentralization. Token holders and community members are encouraged to deliberate on the merits of this improved proposal."
