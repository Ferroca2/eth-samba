        "description": "Given the growing instances of content plagiarism on ContentHub, this proposal suggests introducing an Authorship Verification Mechanism to ensure the authenticity of the content and protect creators' copyrights. An decentralized identity verification system that matches the content with the creator before posting could possibly reduce plagiarism and boost the platform's credibility. Given its potential implications on freedom of posting and user privacy, the proposal urges thorough discussion and feedback from the community and token holders."

Community members can report and review suspicious posts, and strong penalties for proven plagiarists will be enforced. At the same time, users will have access to resources about content authenticity and plagiarism. This approach aims to solidify trust in the platform without limiting creativity or violating user privacy. Community and token holders are encouraged to deliberate on this revised proposal."
