This proposal suggests introducing an ad-based revenue model allowing creators to earn more from their content. Advertisements can provide a vital revenue source for content creators, resulting in increased content and quality. As this may impact viewer experience, a balance must be found between ad frequency and viewer satisfaction. Feedback from the community and token holders is requested."
