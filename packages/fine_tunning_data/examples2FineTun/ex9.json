        "description": "Currently, TrustLend has a fixed interest rate for all loan types irrespective of market fluctuations. This proposal recommends shifting to dynamic interest rates that react to market conditions, ensuring better risk management and incentives for lenders. While this might optimize profits, the change could also impact user experience and requires careful consideration from token holders and the community."

        "description": "Acknowledging the community's diverse views, this revised proposal offers the choice of both fixed and dynamic interest rates. For users preferring stability, fixed rates will remain available. Those comfortable with risk and market navigation could select dynamic rates. Clear parameters will define dynamic rate adjustments, with communication alerts for substantial changes. A maximum cap will ensure borrower protection while dynamic rates will be introduced gradually to allow user adaptation. The dual options aim to cater to a broader range of user preferences, maintaining existing users while appealing to new ones. Token holders are invited to deliberate this comprehensive proposal."
