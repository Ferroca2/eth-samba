        "description": "Presently, in-game assets on GameNet do not depreciate in value or 'age'. However, the introduction of an asset aging mechanism could add realism to games and balance gameplay by gradually reducing the effectiveness of an asset over time. This would incentivise continued participation and promote a dynamic asset market. As significant change to the gaming economy, the proposal invites detailed discussion and feedback from the gaming community and token holders."

        "description": "Considering community feedback, the counterproposal suggests introducing an opt-in asset aging mechanism, allowing players to choose if they want their assets to age. Additionally, a companion feature allowing the rejuvenation or repair of aged assets offers a new layer to gameplay. This hybrid approach maintains the game's appeal to both casual and veteran players, encouraging continued participation and dynamic asset trading while preserving player's investment. As always, the community and token holders are invited to discuss the revised proposal."
