To boost revenue and maintain the platform's high level of service, this proposal suggests increasing the fee to 1.5%. We believe this adjustment can generate more income without discouraging users from utilizing our services. Constructive thoughts and careful evaluation are greatly needed from our community and token holders for this proposed change."

        "title": "Implementation of a Sliding Scale Loan Origination Fee",
        "description": "Considering the diverse views of our community, we propose a revised model for our loan origination fee. Instead of a blanket increase, we're suggesting a sliding scale fee structure based on the loan amount. Smaller loans will continue to attract a 1% fee, while larger loans will incur 1.5%. This strategy maintains accessibility for smaller users while generating additional revenue from bigger loans. Furthermore, revenues from this fee increase will be reinvested into improving the platform's features and enhancing user satisfaction. As with all significant changes, we ensure this plan's flexibility, allowing adjustments based on community feedback and market dynamics. We encourage our community and token holders to carefully evaluate this proposal."
