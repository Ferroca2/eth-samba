        "description": "Due to the increase in cases of online abuse and hate speech on SocialDApp, this proposal introduces AI (Artificial Intelligence) moderation. A machine learning-based system could scan and flag potentially harmful content for review. This auto-moderation feature would allow us to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment. However, considering the possibilities of false positives and the potential stifling of free speech, it encourages community and token holders to share their views."

The AI moderation would flag potentially abusive content, which would then be reviewed by community moderators before any action. Users could challenge the decisions, promoting transparency, and fairness. This combined human-AI approach could provide a robust solution to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment while respecting user privacy. Community and token holders are urged to share insights on this proposed amendment."
