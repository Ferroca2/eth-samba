        "description": "Presently, MusicFlow operates on a pro-rata model, distributing monthly subscription revenues based on total platform streams. This proposal suggests the introduction of 'Fan-Powered Royalties' where each user's subscription fee is distributed solely to the artists they listen to. This model could provide better support to niche artists or those with a dedicated but small fanbase. As this change will impact the earnings of different artists, it invites discussion from the community and token holders."
