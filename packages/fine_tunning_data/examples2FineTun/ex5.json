This proposal suggests implementing a tiered reward system that considers likes, shares, and comments. Such a system could encourage users to create more engaging content, enhancing the overall user experience. This approach needs thoughtful deliberation from the DencentNet community and token holders."

Every post will continue to get a basic reward, acknowledging the user's effort. For contents that receive higher engagement, such as likes, shares, and comments, an additional bonus reward will be provided, fostering quality and creativity. This proposal ensures that new and less popular creators remain incentivized to share their content, while promoting high-engaging content. It also includes setting clear and concrete engagement metrics, enhanced content moderation efforts, and dispute management mechanisms for a fair implementation. The DencentNet community and token holders are urged to deliberate on this updated proposal."
