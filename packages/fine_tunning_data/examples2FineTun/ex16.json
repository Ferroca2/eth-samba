        "description": "DataStore currently employs a flat-rate pricing model, charging the same amount regardless of the volume of data stored. This new proposal aims to introduce a tiered pricing model, where the cost increases with the amount of stored data. The intention is to ensure fair use of storage resources and to prevent network congestion caused by massive storage by a few users. As this can change the cost dynamics for users, we invite the community and token holders to deliberate on this proposal."
