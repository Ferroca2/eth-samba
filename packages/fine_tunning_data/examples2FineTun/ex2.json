    "title": "Implementing a Flat Fee Structure for Storage Market",
    "description": "Currently, Web3Storage operates on a dynamic fee structure based on market demand and supply. This proposal suggests transitioning to a flat fee structure for data storage to simplify pricing and increase transparency. We propose a flat fee of 0.01 tokens/GB. This could attract more users due to the predictability of costs. However, it requires careful consideration from token holders as this shift could potentially impact the protocol's market dynamics and income streams."

    "title": "Adoption of a Tiered Flat Fee Structure for Decentralized Data Storage",
    "description": "In light of the feedback from the token holders, the revised proposal suggests implementation of a tiered flat fee structure for data storage. Under this design, users would pay a lower flat fee per gigabyte as the amount of data stored increases. We could also offer discounts for long-term contracts, incentivizing sustained usage. This responds to concerns about the impact on varying costs of storage in different regions and market conditions. Additionally, this proposal seeks a localized pilot of the new pricing structure to assess its impact before fully transitioning. Careful analysis of potential fiscal impacts and market analysis will be carried out to ensure the viability and sustainability of this new pricing system. Token holders need to contemplate on the potential adaptability and improvements required in Web3Storage's governance and technology in order to facilitate this transition. This plan, although a change, upholds Web3Storage's commitment to competitive pricing, value creation for token holders, and superior service."
